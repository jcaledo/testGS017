# v0.1.7
A new function, orthology(), has been added. This function, which takes as input a file containing the species tree and the gene tree provided by the user, builds an orthology network graph for genes and species beyond those pre-selected in orthGS. Thus, this new version extends the functionality of the package beyond the GS family. A new vignette titled "Orthology beyond GS" has been included to ilustrate the use of the new function.

# v0.1.6
Vignettes modified.

The user is given the choice to used the standalone version of MUSCLE or, alternatvely, to utilize the R packages 'muscle'. Further details can be found in the documentation of the function msa().
